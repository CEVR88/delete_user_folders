# A simple Powershell script to delete folders of users in a server
A simple script to delete some folders with a unique given username.

This Powershell script asks for a username that will be intended as the name of the folders that will be deleted from file system in a server.

This Powershell script automates the task of deleting the folders of a given username contained in a specific location of the network that my team administers. The folders have the same name as the user, and, in some cases, completes their tail with another piece of text.
